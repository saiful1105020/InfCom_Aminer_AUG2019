 Computes the <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Clustering_coefficient#Local_clustering_coefficient">local clustering coefficient</a> of each vertex of a graph. The local clustering coefficient of a node $v$ is given by the expression: $g(v)= \sum_{s \neq v \neq t}\frac{\sigma_{st}(v)}{\sigma_{st}}$ where $\sigma_{st}$ is the total number of shortest paths from node $s$ to node $t$ and $\sigma_{st}(v)$ is the number of those paths that pass through $v$. For more details see <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Clustering_coefficient">wikipedia</a>.

 This implementation computes both the global, the local and the average clustering coefficient in
 an undirected or a directed network.

 This implementation also computes the global clustering coefficient as well as the average clustering coefficient.

 The running time is $O(|V| + \Delta(G)^2)$ where $|V|$ is the number of vertices and $\Delta(G)$ is the maximum degree of a vertex. The space complexity is $O(|V|)$.
